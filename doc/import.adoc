Getting Data into ImageVis3D
============================
The ImageVis3D Team <iv3d-users@sci.utah.edu>

Introduction
------------

One of the most common inquiries we get is, "What is the best way
to get my data into ImageVis3D?"  The answer is invariably specific
to your particular case.  There are a number of ways you can get
ImageVis3D to render your data, with a varying range of associated
complexities.  This document attempts to answer some of the most common
questions.

Briefly, there a couple ways ImageVis3D can load data out of the box:
by loading up a UVF, ImageVis' native image format, or by converting
data into UVF.  However, ImageVis3D is meant to visualize massive
datasets; theoretically up to exabytes of data.  In practice, even for
data as small as a terabyte, the conversion process is going to be too
time consuming for reasonable day-to-day use.

For data at this scale, there are two options: write out your data as
UVF in the first place, or implement a reader which sits parallel to
UVF within ImageVis3D's IO subsystem.  Both impose restrictions on the
structure of your data, and will require someone with C++ programming
experience to make it happen.  However, the payoff is large: ImageVis3D
will be able to open your formats `natively', without the costly
conversion step, and you will no longer have to deal with the same data
replicated across your toolchain's native file format and UVF.

.Use our code!
[NOTE]
====================================================================
ImageVis3D's design is component-based.  In this document, we
will use "the IO subsystem" and "ImageVis3D" interchangeably, but
we are usually referring to the IO library which we have written
specifically for use with ImageVis3D.  Despite the name, the library
is independent of ImageVis3D, and we explicitly encourage those who
are capable to use it separately, in their own applications!  More
information is available by asking on the mailing lists.
====================================================================

Broadly, both schemes accept data on regular (though potentially
anisotropic) grids.  The converted formats are what we will refer
to as 'single-block', meaning that the entire dataset lives in one
large array, regardless of how large the dataset is.  By comparison,
ImageVis3D's variant of UVF is inherently 'multi-block', meaning that
large data are "chunked", such that multiple "chunks" are required to
recreate the entire volume.  Single-block data is inherently simpler
and has more support from existing tools.  Multi-block data is more
complex, but -- even ignoring ImageVis3D for a moment and speaking
from a purely algorithmic standpoint -- there is simply no way to
scale single-block data access to provide efficient visualization and
analysis for large data.

Grid Types
----------

Data can be defined on a wide variety of grid types.  ImageVis3D can
handle "regular" gridded data as well as geometry, though at present
all geometry data must be associated with some kind of volume data.


Gridded data is similar to an image file: it is defined as a series of
voxels, with an implicit ordering and distance between each voxel.
That is, if we call a pixel `x` and define a pixel `x+1` to be the
pixel to the right of `x`, then we know that the distance between `x`
and `x+1` is equal to the distance between `x+1` and `x+2`.  Regular
data is an extension of this property to 3D: all data are layed out on
an even grid.

.Example Regular Gridded Data (`.` represents a grid location)
........................................
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
........................................

However, do note that ImageVis3D supports so-called *anisotropic* data.
That is, the difference in space between `x` and `x+1` need not be
equal to the difference between `y` and `y+1`.  More succinctly, the
spacing information can vary per-dimension, but not within a dimension.

ImageVis3D can also associate geometry with a volume.  This geometry
must be in the form of a triangle mesh or a set of lines.  Note that
some formats have more complicated meshes, which are triangulated on
the fly during load to meet this requirement.

If your data do not exemplify regular grid data or geometry, ImageVis3D
will not be able to handle it natively.  For now, your best bet to
be able to import such data into ImageVis3D is to resample it onto a
regular grid.  The http://www.visitusers.org/[VisIt] software package
might be able to do this resampling for you; a sample Python script
which uses VisIt to do this is given later in this document (see the
section on the "BOV" file format).

Existing File Formats
---------------------

ImageVis3D might already support converting the formats you care
about into its native UVF container format.  You might also consider
rewriting data in one of these formats to better support ImageVis3D.
If your data are inherently single-block, this will be your quickest
path to loading and visualizing your data.

Volume Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

For 3D gridded volume data, ImageVis3D supports:

- *DICOM stacks* (`.dcm` extension, normally): A set of DICOM files which form a
  volume.  Use the "Load Dataset from Directory" feature to load these
  datasets.
- *Image stacks* (`.png`, `.tif`, `.bmp`, `.jpeg`/`.jpg`, `.qif` extensions):
  sets of 2D images which form a volume when rendered together.  As with DICOM
  stacks, use the "Load Dataset from Directory" feature to load these datasets.
- *QVis* (`.dat` extension): QVis header and accompanying raw data
- *NRRD* (`.nrrd` and `.nhdr` extensions): NRRD files, as output by the
  link:http://teem.sf.net/[Teem] library and associated tools.
- *Stack* (`.stk` extension): Metamorph "stack" files; a special case of TIFFs,
  output by the Metamorph software package.
- *TIFF* (`.tiff`, `.tif` extensions): A TIFF stack; these differ from an image
  stack in that the entire volume is stored in a single file.
- *VFF* (`.vff` extension): Visualization File Format
- *Brick of Values* (`.bov` extension): A raw 3D array and associated header; a
  common method to export data from the link:http://www.visitusers.org/[VisIt]
  software package.
- *REK* (`.rek` extension): Fraunhofer Raw format.
- *Inveon* (`.hdr` extension, with accompanying `.img`): files from Inveon
  scanner.
- *Analyze* (`.hdr` extension, with accompanying `.img`): Analyze 7.5 files.
- *Amira* (`.am` extension): so-called "AmiraMesh" files, which, despite the
  name, consist of gridded 3D volume data.
- *Raw* data, optionally compressed

DICOM Stacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^

DICOMs are notoriously difficult to parse, work with, and have
poor access times.  Do not use DICOM if you are not already.  We will not
document the format here, but if you are dead-set on this format, you can find
the entire ~3000 page specification on link:http://medical.nema.org/[the
official DICOM web site].

Image Stacks
^^^^^^^^^^^^

ImageVis3D supports loading sets of images in the common formats.
Specifications for each image type are beyond the scope of this
document.  If you are designing a new visualization pipeline, we would
discourage reliance on image stacks due to slow access times.

For many if not all image types, image data is downsampled to 8bits
before it is handed to ImageVis3D's IO subsystem.  This is fixable, but
at present has yet to be a pressing concern.  Please let us know if
this is a significant hurdle for your data.

QVis
^^^^

QVis is a simple 'header + data' file format.  The file which the user
selects via the ImageVis3D UI, which must have the extension `.dat`, is
comprised of a series of ASCII key-value pairs.  One of these pairs,
with the `ObjectFileName` key, gives the name of a file which contains
raw data.

QVis is currently the only mechanism by which one can load color data
into ImageVis3D.  Other file formats are capable of storing color data,
but code must be added to the converter to inform higher levels of
ImageVis3D to handle the data correctly.  QVis would be a good format
to standardize around if you were designing a pipeline to work with
single-block, raw data.

An example `.dat` file is:

.......................................
  ObjectFileName: body.raw16
  TaggedFileName: ---
  Resolution:     512 512 1884
  SliceThickness: 1 1 1
  Format:         USHORT
  NbrTags:        0
  ObjectType:     TEXTURE_VOLUME_OBJECT
  ObjectModel:    RGBA
  GridType:       EQUIDISTANT
.......................................

This describes a `512x512x1884` dataset, stored as 16-bit unsigned
integers (`USHORT` s).  As such, one would expect the data file,
`body.raw16`, to be 987,758,592 bytes (`512 x 512 x 1884`, times
2 bytes per element because the data are 16-bit).  Despite the
`ObjectModel`, this is not color data, because the `Format` implies
there is only a single element per grid location.  The user might
have specified color data by dictating the format was `USHORT4` data,
indicating there are 4 unsigned short values per grid location.  This
volume is isotropic ("1 1 1" `SliceThickness`, `EQUIDISTANT` grid
type).

If you would like to write your own QVis data exporters, we recommend:

- Always put the `ObjectFileName` as the first key available in the header.
- Include the `TaggedFileName`, `NbrTags`, `ObjectType`, `ObjectModel`, and
  `GridType` keys, even though ImageVis3D will ignore them (just copy the
  values used above, if nothing else).  You never know when some other piece
  of software will require those fields.
- Stick to `CHAR`/`BYTE`, `UCHAR`, `SHORT`, `USHORT`, `UCHAR4` (color data),
  and `FLOAT` for your `Format` s.  Other types are not currently implemented!
  Patches are welcome.

Nearly Raw Raster Data (NRRD)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NRRD is a single-block format comprised of a header with
accompanying data.  The NRRD file format is described extensively
link:http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/format.html[on its web site].

ImageVis3D's implementation suffers from some quirks because it
eschews the use of the more general Teem library.  We would welcome
contributions which would allow ImageVis3D to understand more of NRRD's
fields.  At the very least, please provide bug reports if you find
fields which are not understood by ImageVis3D.

NRRDs can be "attached" or "detached", the former meaning that metadata
and data appear concatenated in a single file, and the latter meaning
that the metadata information contains a specific tag which details
a second file comprising the data.  In the "detached" form, the file
extension is normally ".nhdr" instead of ".nrrd".

Metamorph "Stack" Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metamorph "Stack" files are a special case of TIFF.  ImageVis3D can
read them by forcing the underlying `libtiff` library to read TIFF
headers which it does not natively understand.

This is a compatibility format; it exists solely to ease migration from
past and present Metamorph users.  If you have a choice, do not use
this format.

TIFF Volumes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

While the majority of TIFFs contain just a single image inside them,
a little known feature of the format is that it stores each image in
what it calls a `Directory'.  Most TIFFs you would find on the web or
in similar places consist of a single Directory, but some scientific
software can generate these multi-directory TIFFs.

TIFF volumes suffer from poor access time, because each image
slice is stored separately instead of as a continuous volume.
Further, the bundled converter for TIFF volumes is among the worst in
ImageVis3D: ImageVis3D assumes that an input volume is a contiguous
chunk of data.  As such, the converter must read each slice and append
it into a single volume, requiring significantly increased temporary
disk storage, as well as a costly additional conversion step.

It is not recommended you utilize TIFF volumes if given the choice, but
the format may be convenient for interoperation with other software.
If you do go this route, we recommend utilizing the `libtiff`
library, which has link:http://www.libtiff.org/libtiff.html[excellent
documentation].

VFF
^^^

This format was written for a specific collaborator.  It is a `header
+ data' format, very similar to an attached NRRD.  Little other
information is available at this time.

Brick of Values (BOV)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a compatibility format, meant to allow importing data from the
VisIt software package.  It is a header + data format, very similar in
concept to a detached NRRD.

In some cases, a BOV may be split into multiple files, using a special
`%` notation for the filenames within the header.  This variation is
not supported by ImageVis3D.  To ensure you will only have a single
data file, make sure you have a "single block" dataset in VisIt.  You
can obtain one by applying a non-distributed "Resample" operation on
the data.

Here is a VisIt-python script which converts a dataset in the
`/path/to/dataset.silo` file into a 512^3 volume which ImageVis3D could
import:

[python]
source~~~~
include::helium.py[]
source~~~~

After modifying the `db = ...` line, invoke the script with:
`/path/to/visit -cli -nowin -s script.py`.

Fraunhofer Raw Volumes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a simple binary format which directly supports a collaborator's
work.  Not much else is known at this time, but you could ask for more
information on the
link:https://lists.sci.utah.edu/sympa/subscribe/tuvok-developers[tuvok-developers]
mailing list.

Inveon
^^^^^^

The Inveon format is a header + data format, similar in concept to a
detached NRRD.  In ImageVis3D, users select a `.hdr` file, which is
assumed to correspond to a `.img` file: the "header" file must be named
exactly the same as the `.img` file, except with the `.hdr` *appended*
(so that the file appears to have multiple extensions).

The format typically stores CT data.  Header files consist of lines of
metadata with parameters appearing after keys.  Currently, ImageVis3D
only recognizes version "001.910" of these files, due to a lack of
other data to test with.  The format is simple and efficient, but
verbose and ill-documented, with unknown support in other tools;
therefore it is recommended that other formats be used in your
visualization solutions, if you have the choice.

Analyze
^^^^^^^

The Analyze file format was developed at the Mayo Clinic as part of a
software package of the same name.  Do note that there are multiple
versions of this format; ImageVis3D supports the 7.5 variant.

Data sets in this format consist of small `.hdr` files which describe
the data, and then put raw data in `.img` files.

Amira
^^^^^

Amira is a visualization package developed by "Visage Imaging".  The
program can export so-called "AmiraMesh" files, which are ASCII files
which consist of a small header and a raw listing of the data.

Amira can also export ".grd" ("grid") files, which ImageVis3D does not
currently support.  If this is a limiting factor for you, please let us
know!  Adding support for this variation shouldn't be too difficult.

"AmiraMesh" would be a poor choice to standardize around for your
data visualization and analysis needs, because it does not support
anisotropy and data access is extremely slow.

Raw Data
^^^^^^^^

If ImageVis3D cannot identify your data type, it will assume the data
are raw and open up a conversion dialog to specify the data parameters.

This converter expects that data will be 3 dimensional.  Data must be
layed out, as the name implies, in a 'raw' manner; if there is metadata
stored between data values, this converter will not function correctly.
It can, however, skip over some bytes at the beginning of a data file,
to accomodate typical "header + value" formats.

The data must vary in X slowest, and Z quickest.  If this is not the
case for your data, you should swap X and Z dimensions that you input.
Note that 'X slow, Z fast' corresponds to what many think of as the "C"
way to write data, whereas 'Z fast, X slow' corresponds to what many
people consider "Fortran arrays".

The raw conversion dialog is not available when ImageVis3D is run in
batch mode, as is the case when scripting commands are being executed.
The source repository includes a command line tool to batch convert a
set of datasets.

Geometry Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Geometry also supports loading meshes and rendering them concurrently
with volumes.

- *OBJ* (`.obj` extension): geometry definition popularized by Wavefront
software packages.
- *PLY* (`.ply` extension): the file format used for the
http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/mich/[Digital Michelangelo]
project.
- *MedAlyVis* (`.trk`, `.tri` extensions): collaborator-specific format.
- *IV3D Mobile* (`.g3d`, `.g3dx` extensions): format used to render geometry in
ImageVis3D Mobile.


OBJ
^^^

The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obj[obj file format] is a fairly
simple ascii-based file format which is incredibly popular.  This is a
good format to choose for interoperation with other tools, but is not
efficient and thus not a good choice for large data.

ImageVis3D can only render geometry which consists of triangular
faces.  OBJ files can, however, store meshes with an arbitrary number
of vertices per face.  ImageVis3D will triangulate such data during
conversion.

PLY
^^^

PLY is the format used for a variety of models from the Stanford model
repository.  These are typically scans of objects which have been
obtained via a high resolution laser scanner.  The models have become
very popular in visualization and computer graphics research, as a test
bed for algorithms.

MedAlyVis
^^^^^^^^^

This software does not appear to be generally available, but has a
relatively simple format.  The format might be a good choice if you do
not have an existing format and need to import some simple triangle
meshes into ImageVis3D.

.MedAlyVis Geometry File Format
[options="header"]
|=============================================================================
| Field | Type | Byte Offset | Width
| number of vertices | 32-bit unsigned integer | 0 | 4
| number of triangles | 32-bit unsigned integer | 4 | 4
| vertex | float | 8 | 12/element
| triangle indices | 3x 32-bit unsigned integer | 8 + sizeof(vertex data) |
12/element
|=============================================================================

Do note that data are assumed to be written out in the same endianness
of the machine which is reading the data.

IV3D Mobile
^^^^^^^^^^^

ImageVis3D mobile is the mobile counterpart to ImageVis3D.

Adding a Volume Data Converter
------------------------------

:leveloffset: 1
include::add-converter.adoc[]

:leveloffset: 0

Adding a Geometry Converter
---------------------------

The conversion interface for geometric data is very similar to that of
volume data.

1. Create a new class, derived from `AbstrGeoConverter`.
2. Register your class with the IO subsystem.
3. Override the `ConvertToMesh` function to read a file and create an
   in-memory mesh.

Geometry Converter Skeleton
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need both a header file (`.h`) and an implementation file
(`.cpp`) for your format.  They should define a class, derived from
`AbstrGeoConverter`, which implements the `ConvertToMesh` method.
Here's an example header file:

[c++]
source~~~~~
#include "AbstrGeoConverter.h"

namespace tuvok {

class YourConverter : public AbstrGeoConverter {
public:
  YourConverter();
  virtual Mesh* ConvertToMesh(const std::string& strFilename);
};

}
source~~~~

For now, just sketch out the implementation file by returning `NULL` in
the mesh loading routine:

[c++]
source~~~~
#include "YourConverter.h"

YourConverter::YourConverter() {}
Mesh* YourConverter::ConvertToMesh(const std::string& fn)
{
    return NULL;
}
source~~~~

Building Your Geometry Converter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just like when implementing your volume data converter, you'll need to
add your source files to the project files so that they will be built
as part of ImageVis.  Open up `Tuvok/Tuvok.pro` in a text editor and
add your converter to both the '`HEADERS`' and '`SOURCES`' variables:

............................
  HEADERS += \
    ...
    IO/AbstrGeoConverter.h \
    IO/YourFileHere.h \
    IO/PLYGeoConverter.h \
    ...
  SOURCES += \
    ...
    IO/AbstrGeoConverter.cpp \
    IO/YourFileHere.cpp \
    IO/PLYGeoConverter.cpp \
    ...
............................

On Windows, the visual studio project files are separate from the qmake
profile files.  Please be sure to add your new files into the `.pro`
file anyway, however; otherwise your additions will not be available on
Linux or Apple platforms.

Register Your Geometry Converter with the IO Subsystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To inform ImageVis3D that your converter exists, you need to register
it with the IO subsystem.  Open up `IOManager.cpp` and add a `#include`
line for your converter's header file.  Then, in the `IOManager`
constructor, add a line which creates an instance of your converter and
adds it to the list of available geometry converters:

[c++]
source~~~~
  m_vpGeoConverters.push_back(new YourConverter());
source~~~~

Register Your File Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The constructor for your geometry converter should modify two internal
class variables: `m_vConverterDesc` and `m_vSupportedExt`.  The former
should be set to a short human-readable string that describes the
format.  This must be a single line and should generally be a short
phrase of a few words or less -- for example, "Wavefront Object File".
The second variable is a vector which holds the valid file extensions
for the format, using only capital letters and without the trailing
".".

[c++]
source~~~~
YourConverter::YourConverter()
{
  m_vConverterDesc = "My File Format";
  m_vSupportedExt.push_back("YOUR");
  m_vSupportedExt.push_back("YUR");
}
source~~~~~

Implement `ConvertToMesh`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is where all the work is done.  You should allocate a
`tuvok::Mesh` on the heap, fill in all the information you can, and
return it from this method.

Implementing a Reader Parallel to UVF
-------------------------------------

If your data format meets certain criteria, it is possible for you to
write a reader which sits parallel to UVF.  This will allow ImageVis3D
to read your data natively, without any conversion process.  For
extremely large data, a conversion process is infeasible.

NOTE: Only volume data is currently supported via this interface;
geometry data must be loaded via the conversion interface.

The criteria your format must meet are:

- You must meet the 'standard' requirements for ImageVis3D data: namely, your
data must be defined on a regular, though potentially anisotropic, grid.
- Your data must be 'bricked'; a large volume is composed of a set of small
volumes.
- You have at least two levels of resolution for your data; in general, more
levels will be better, within reason.
- The coarsest resolution of your data consists of a single 'brick'.
- You can load the coarsest resolution of your data in 3- or 4-hundred
milliseconds.

Further, this is the most complicated of methods to get your data into
ImageVis3D.  Someone in your lab must be capable of writing C++ code.

Writing Your Reader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic steps involved in writing your own reader are:

1. Create a new class derived from `FileBackedDataset`.
2. Register your format with the IO subsystem.
3. Implement `CanRead` and `Create` (may already be present) methods, to allow the IO system to identify
your dataset type.
4. Implement methods to query data and metadata from your dataset.

Reader Skeleton
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You'll need to create a header file (`.h`) and an implementation file
(`.cpp`) for your new format.  They should define a new class which
includes a large set of methods.

1. Copy `Dataset.h` to `<YourFormat>.h`
2. Modify `YourFormat.h`:
* Add the header `FileBackedDataset.h`, remove other headers.
* Derive the class from `FileBackedDataset`.
* Make all of the pure virtual methods simply virtual.
* Add `CanRead` and `Create` methods with the same signatures as from
`FileBackedDataset`.

Next, stub out an implementation file.  At this stage, we highly
recommend you do not attempt to implement your reader, but instead
just add the minimal return statements required for compilation.  For
instance, implement the `GetLODLevelCount` method like so:

[c++]
source~~~~
virtual UINT64 GetLODLevelCount() const { return 0; }
source~~~~

etc.

Building Your Reader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need to add your new reader to the build.  The files which are
part of the IO subsystem are currently listed in the 'Tuvok/Tuvok.pro'.
You'll find `HEADERS` and `SOURCES` variables in that file, which list
all of the files involved in the build.  You must add you reader to
both variables.

............................................................................
  HEADERS += \
           ...
           IO/AbstrConverter.h \
           IO/BOVConverter.h \
           IO/*YourReaderHere.h* \
           IO/BrickedDataset.h \
           ...
  SOURCES += \
           ...
           IO/AbstrConverter.cpp \
           IO/BOVConverter.cpp \
           IO/*YourReaderHere.cpp* \
           IO/BrickedDataset.cpp \
           ...
............................................................................

IMPORTANT: On Windows, `qmake` is unfortunately no longer used.  You
must add your files to the Visual Studio project file in the normal
way on this platform.  Make sure to add your files to the `.pro` file
anyway, though -- it will be required for the Linux and Mac builds.

You can now compile ImageVis3D and test that your new class includes
all the right methods.

Register Your Data Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For ImageVis3D to attempt using your format, it must know how to
identify your files.  Two steps are required here: you must implement
the `CanRead` and `Create` methods, and you must register your format
with the `IOManager`.

`CanRead` and `Create`
++++++++++++++++++++++

`CanRead` is straightforward; it must return `true` when the file is in
your format.  Normally you would do this by verifying the magic bytes
at the beginning of the file.

`Create` is a simple "virtual constructor"; you just need to
instantiate an object of your class.  The constructor of your class, or
the `Create` method itself, is allowed to throw any exception derived
from `DSOpenFailed` (see `TuvokIOError.h`) to indicate any errors
encountered while actually opening the file.

IMPORTANT: Do *not* report errors in the `CanRead` method!  Save error
detection for `Create`.

`uvfDataset.cpp` provides a good example of how these methods might
be implemented.  Note that `UVFDataset` does its error detection in
`Open`, which is automatically called from the constructor.

Registration with the IO Subsystem
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This just requires a small addition to the `IOManager`.  Open up
`IOManager.cpp` and find the constructor.  There is already a line to
register UVF with the IO manager:

[c++]
source~~~~
m_dsFactory->AddReader(std::shared_ptr<UVFDataset>(new UVFDataset()));
source~~~~

Add a similar line for your reader.  You will also need to add a
`#include` line slightly above the constructor.

Test!
+++++

At this point, ImageVis3D should be able to both identify and at
least attempt to read your data.  It will return garbage values for
just about every inquiry, but now would be a good time to test the
registration.  Selecting one of your files from the ImageVis3D UI
should attempt to open it, and promptly report some sort of error --
probably complaining about the lack of data in the file.

The exact error is unimportant.  The important thing is that ImageVis3D
does not prompt you for a UVF file name after selecting your file.
This indicates that ImageVis3D knows about your format and recognizes
that it does not require conversion.

Implement `Dataset` Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are too many dataset methods to exhaustively outline
implementations for each one of them.  We outline them by categories
here.  For specific details, see the doxygen comments, and/or follow
the implementation in `uvfDataset.cpp`.

NOTE: Never cache any *data* in your reader implementation.  Tuvok,
ImageVis3D's renderer, implements caching of bricks at a level slightly
higher than your dataset.  You will defeat its memory management
routines by wasting memory in your dataset, which may lead to excessive
swapping.  Caching metadata, or other small information about data, is
fine.  If you feel you must store a large amount of information, you
should tie into the memory management system to "register" your memory.

Histograms
++++++++++

ImageVis3D requires 1D and 2D histograms to use as the backdrop of the
transfer function editors.

UVF stores these histograms in the file.  The `GetHistograms` method
initializes the `m_pHistXD` variables.  This occurs when the UVF is
first opened.  The alternative would be to generate these on the fly
and cache the results.  We highly discourage such an ad hoc histogram
calculation: for one, users will have to pay for it every time they
open your file.  Secondly, the calculations can take significant time,
and that time is taken between when the user selects the file and when
they see a window opening on their screen.  Your format will look very
slow if it does a long calculation at this point.

Do note that the calculation of a 2D histogram is an *extremely*
expensive operation.  ImageVis3D only calculates the 2D histogram for
the coarsest level of detail, _even though we have a preprocess to
generate these data_!  You are welcome to implement an exact solution,
but be careful about how much work you do at open time.

Brick Inquiries
+++++++++++++++

`GetBrick...` functions query data and metadata about a brick.  Of
course, the most important of these is the `GetBrick` method itself,
which loads the data for a brick.  This method takes a `BrickKey`
and is expected to fill the `std::vector` argument with the data for
that brick.  The `BrickKey` is under your control: when you open your
file, you should make a series of `AddBrick` calls, each with a unique
`BrickKey`.  ImageVis3D will then use those `BrickKey` s to request
data from your Dataset implementation.  You can "encode" whatever
information you need into that key; as an example, `UVFDataset` encodes
the spatial position of a brick in the "brick index" portion of the
key.  The `IndexToVector` method then decodes the "brick index" back
into the 3D index.

Data Type and Size
++++++++++++++++++

There are a variety of methods, such as `GetBitWidth` and
`GetIsSigned`, which are used to identify features of the dataset.
These provide important information on how the data received out of
`GetBrick` is interpreted.

`Extensions`
++++++++++++

You must implement a method named `Extensions` which takes no
arguments and returns a list of strings.  ImageVis3D will use this
information to generate the formats utilized in the "Open" window.  See
`uvfDataset.cpp` for an example implementation.

*Optional*: `Verify`
++++++++++++++++++++

`Verify` is how you would implement an "expensive" check for your file
format.  UVF calculates a checksum by reading the entire file, and
compares it to a precalculated checksum in the file.

Keep in mind that the user can disable this check through the
ImageVis3D UI.

*Optional*: Rescale Factors
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These are normally handled by your parent classes.  However, there is
one method, `SaveRescaleFactors` that you may reimplement.  If the user
changes the rescale factors in the UI and then selects "Save To File",
ImageVis3D will call this method.  You should re-open your file in
read-write, and add some metadata about the spacings in the X, Y, and Z
axes.

*Optional*: First/Last Bricks
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`Dataset` contains two methods, `BrickIsFirstInDimension` and
`BrickIsLastInDimension`, which inform the renderer whether or not
they are the "leftmost" or "rightmost" brick.  `BrickedDataset` does
provide a default implementation for these methods, so ImageVis3D will
work even if you do not override them.  However, `BrickedDataset` has
very limited knowledge of your dataset; it requires `O(n)` time in
the number of bricks to answer this.  Some formats can answer this
in constant time.  If you can do so, it is highly recommended you
implement these methods; it will significantly speed up ImageVis3D's
"frame planning" algorithms.

*Optional*: Acceleration Queries
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These consist of the `ContainsData` methods.  These are meant to
key into any acceleration structures you might store in a file, and
allow ImageVis3D to reject bricks without rendering them.  This can
significantly increase performance when available.

They are given a brick key and some kind of information on what
ImageVis3D is looking for.  There are three methods, one for each of
the primary render modes.  As an example, the two-argument version of
`ContainsData` is used when rendering isosurfaces.  If the user selects
an isosurface of 42, and you know that a given brick only has values
from 96 to 428, then there is no reason to render that brick, and so
`ContainsData` would return false.

Do not scan your data to identify the results of these methods.  The
GPU will do that much quicker than you could ever dream of doing here.
However, if you have precomputed this information, implement these
methods to significantly increase performance.

*Optional*: `Export`
++++++++++++++++++++

ImageVis3D can also be used as a converter from one file format to
another.  The `Export` method helps in doing this.  If you implement
this method, you should serialize your data to the file name given in
the argument, in a completely "raw" (unbricked) form.

If you do not care about this functionality, just ignore this method.
The default implementation already indicates that the export operation
has failed.

*Optional*: `Name`
++++++++++++++++++

While not strictly required, you should implement a `Name` method. This
simply returns a user-centric name which describes your data format.
The string should be short; you just want to differentiate this from
other formats.  As an example, ImageVis3D's native format returns the
string, "Universal Volume Format".

Converting Your Output Format to ImageVis3D's UVF
-------------------------------------------------

UVF is more of a container format than a full file format.  The primary
author of this document considers it more of a filesystem than a
file format.  This is because UVF is very general, relying on the
applications which implement it for some of the semantic value of
the data.  As an example, with existing code it would be easy to
write a 9-dimensional, 6-channel tensor dataset into a UVF file.
ImageVis3D will have absolutely no idea how to render that data, but it
is perfectly valid as a UVF file.

UVF does, however, provide a means to query the kind of data stored in
the file.  If ImageVis3D encountered such a dataset, it would simply
ignore that data.  This is the recommended way to handle UVF files:
pull out the portions your application understands, and ignore the
rest.

This naturally only works if the format itself supports multiple
independent 'portions'.  UVF supports this natively, and in fact
ImageVis3D itself makes use of a few different 'portions', or, in UVF
parlance, 'blocks'.  Each block is almost like a file in-and-of itself;
it contains a small header detailing specifics of that block, followed
by whatever payload is relevant.  A global header presides over the
entire UVF file, giving very general information and helping to index
the various blocks which exist in the file.

An academic paper about UVF
link:http://www.sci.utah.edu/scipubs/search.html?schTerm=Unified+Volume+Format&year=2010&schGroup=&entrytype=[was
published]
while the format was still in its infancy.  The format has changed
slightly since then, but not in concept, and the changes have actually
been surprisingly minor.  As such, it still provides a relevant overview of
UVF's format, features, and design goals.

Unified Volume Format Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In brief, UVF files start with a common header.  After the header
follows a series of blocks, each with specialized data contained within
them.  All blocks contain a block header, and share a common subset
of header information, which appears before block-specific header
information.

Master Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first bytes within a UVF comprise the 'Master Header': a global
header for the file which describes globally relevant parameters.  In
order, these components are:

- The raw, constant bytes: `0x55 0x56 0x46 0x2d 0x44 0x41 0x54 0x41`.  These
  are UVF's "magic" bytes; many files may begin with these bytes, but a UVF
  file will never begin with anything different.  Note that these bytes, if
  interpreted as ASCII characters, spell out the string "UVF-DATA".
- A single byte which details whether the file stores data in little or big
  endian.  Zero values imply little endianness; non-zero values imply big
  endian data.  This effects all subsequent data in the file, from the next
  values in this header, to data stored within UVF's blocks.
- An unsigned, 64-bit integer which gives the version of the UVF file.
  ImageVis3D wrote out version 2 UVF files since 1.0 was released in May 2009.
  However, starting in August 2010 ImageVis3D has begun writing
  out version 3 UVF files, and will do so in a release starting with
  version 2.0.  ImageVis3D does not support version 0 or 1 UVF files,
  and any differences between those and version 2 will not be documented
  here.
- An unsigned, 64-bit integer which details how the file checksum was
  calculated, according to the following table.

.Integer Representation of Checksum Calculation Method
[width="70%", frame="all", cols="1,10", options="header"]
|====================================================================
|Value | Meaning of the 64-bit value
| 0    | No checksum exists
| 1    | The checksum was calculated via a simple crc32 algorithm
| 2    | The popular MD5 algorithm was used to calculate the checksum
| 3    | An unknown method was used to calculate the checksum
| *    | Undefined.  Reserved.
|====================================================================

- An unsigned, 64-bit integer containing `n_checksum_bytes`, the number
  of bytes in the checksum.

IMPORTANT: The number of bytes in the checksum *always* appears, even
if the type of checksum is 'none' (i.e. `0`, as per above)!  Of course,
this field will be set to 0 if that is the case.

- `n_checksum_bytes` of data which comprise the file's checksum.
- An unsigned, 64-bit integer giving the number of bytes to seek _from
  the position after reading this element_ (i.e., use `SEEK_CUR`).  For
  example, if you are using the C streams interface, code to read this
  element and seek to the first block might look like this:

[c++]
source~~~~
  uint64_t seek;
  fread(&seek, sizeof(uint64_t), 1, fp);
  if(needed) { /* as per the endianness byte, above */
    seek = bswap_64(seek);
  }
  fseek(fp, seek, SEEK_CUR);
  /* fread now will read the first byte of the first real block */
source~~~~

- Any number (including 0) of undefined bytes.  Future UVF versions may
  add meaning to the bytes starting here and up to the first data block, so
  _portable UVF readers must seek over these bytes_!

Data Blocks
^^^^^^^^^^^

There are relatively few data blocks currently defined.  They are: 1D
histograms, 2D histograms, Key-value pairs, maximum and minimum data
values, raster data, and geometry data.

All data blocks start with a common header.  The data in this header,
in order, is:

- An unsigned, 64-bit integer detailing the size of ...
- ... a series of bytes forming an ASCII string which describes the
  block's type.  This element is intended for display in, for example, a
  UI that lets one view and manipulate UVF blocks, *not* for doing string
  comparisons to figure out what kind of data are in the block.
* Do note that the "size" integer does *not* include the terminating null byte!
- The semantic type of a block, which details the specific data block present.

.Semantic Block Types
[width="50%", frame="all", cols="1,10", options="header"]
|====================================================================
|Value | Meaning of the 64-bit value
| 0    | Empty.  This should not occur in production.
| 1    | Regular, N-dimensional gridded data ("Raster data").
| 2    | An N-dimensional representation for a transfer function
| 3    | Preview image, meant to give an idea what is in the file
| 4    | Key value pairs: strings used to provide extraneous metadata
| 5    | 1D Histogram
| 6    | 2D Histogram
| 7    | Maximum and minimum data values (acceleration structure)
| 8    | Geometry
| *    | Undefined.  Reserved.
|====================================================================

- The type of compression used for the block.

.Block Compression Type
[width="50%", frame="all", cols="1,10", options="header"]
|====================================================================
|Value | Meaning of the 64-bit value
| 0    | None; the block is not compressed
| *    | Undefined.  Reserved.
|====================================================================

- An unsigned, 64-bit integer offset to the next block.  This is
  relative to the _beginning_ of the current block.  A value of `0`
  indicates that this is the final data block in the UVF.

1D Histogram Data Block
+++++++++++++++++++++++

This data block essentially contains just an array of values which form
a histogram for a scalar dataset.

- First 64 bits: unsigned integer which gives the `histogram_size`
- `histogram_size` 64-bit elements following that: the histogram.
  Indices into the array detail the data value; values in the array give
  the number of times that data value occurs.  Thus, if `arr[8] == 19`,
  then the value `8` occurs in the dataset `19` times.

The association between histograms and datasets is purely implicit.  If
a UVF contains two dataset blocks and one 1D histogram block, it is
technically ambiguous as to which dataset the histogram was computed
from.  In ImageVis3D's UVF, mappings are 1:1; the situation listed here
would be an error.

2D Histogram Data Block
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Stores a 2D histogram for a given dataset.  Essentially, this stores
a contiguous array of 1D histograms.  The histogram is assumed to be
"square": the second dimension does not vary from its initial value.
ImageVis3D assumes that the second dimension is gradient magnitude.

- First 32-bits: IEEE-754 representation of the max gradient magnitude.
- Following 64 bits: unsigned integer count, `elems_X`.
- Following 64 bits: unsigned integer count, `elems_Y`.
- Final `elems_X` x `elems_Y` x 64 bits: the histogram, with X as the slowest
  moving dimension.

Key Value Pairs Block
+++++++++++++++++++++

Stores a set of simple string-based key-value pairs. This is typically
used to store metadata about the dataset which are not relevant to
visualization.

- First 64-bits: unsigned integer `n_elements`.
- `n_elements` of:
* 64-bit unsigned integer giving a `key_length`
* `key_length` bytes storing an ASCII "key" string.
* 64-bit unsigned integer giving a `value_length`
* `value_length` bytes storing an ASCII "value" string.

Raster Data Block
+++++++++++++++++

This is where ImageVis3D stores the data it renders. It is intended to
store N-dimensional, regularly gridded data.

- First 64-bits: unsigned integer `n_dimensions`
- Only if `n_dimensions` is non-zero:
* `n_dimensions` 64-bit semantic block identifiers
* `n_dimensions+1` x `n_dimensions+1` IEEE-854 64-bit FP values storing a
  default transformation.
* `n_dimensions` 64-bit unsigned integers giving the size of the domain,
slowest dimension first.
* `n_dimensions` 64-bit unsigned integers giving the size used for bricks,
slowest dimension first.
* `n_dimensions` 64-bit unsigned integers giving the overlap among bricks
* `n_dimensions` 64-bit unsigned integers giving the factor by which
successive domains are downsampled.
* `n_dimensions` 64-bit unsigned integers ???
- `n_dimensions` 64-bit unsigned integers giving the number of LODs for each
dimension of the data.
- a 64-bit unsigned integer, `n_elements`
- `n_elements` 64-bit unsigned integers giving the element size, `el_size`.
- This repeats `n_elements` times; let `i` equal the iteration number:
* `el_size[i]` 64-bit unsigned semantic identifiers
* `el_size[i]` 64-bit unsigned bit sizes: number of bits per element.
* `el_size[i]` 64-bit unsigned mantissas
...


_(Sadly, this part of the documentation is not complete.  In the meantime, see
the source for more information.)_

Geometry Block
++++++++++++++

This block stores a collection of indexed triangles.  It exists only in
version 3 UVF files and up; it is an error to write a geometry block
into a UVF with a version number of 2 or lower.

Geometry data are 3-dimensional.  The format for the block is quite
simple.  First, a header gives size information for arrays (all sizes
are in bytes):

.Geometry Block Header
[cols="1,6,1,2", options="header"]
|=============================================================================
| Byte offset | Field                         | Field Width | Field Type
|  0          | number of vertices            |     8       | unsigned integer
|  8          | number of normals             |     8       | unsigned integer
| 16          | number of texture coordinates |     8       | unsigned integer
| 24          | number of color values        |     8       | unsigned integer
| 32          | number of vertex indices      |     8       | unsigned integer
| 40          | number of normal indices      |     8       | unsigned integer
| 48          | number of tex coord indices   |     8       | unsigned integer
| 64          | number of color indices       |     8       | unsigned integer
| 72          | default color, "R" channel    |     4       | IEEE-754 float
| 76          | default color, "G" channel    |     4       | IEEE-754 float
| 80          | default color, "B" channel    |     4       | IEEE-754 float
| 84          | default color, "A" channel    |     4       | IEEE-754 float
| 88          | length of a string            |     8       | unsigned integer
| 96          | description of the data       |   variable  | character
| 96+str len  | vertices per polygon          |     8       | unsigned integer
|=============================================================================

Afterwards comes the `vertices`, `normals`, `texture coordinates`, and
`color` data, all as IEEE-754 floating point arrays, and in that order.
They are sized as given in the header.  Note that the sizes give the
number of elements in the array, not the number of elements.  Since
a vertex consists of 3 elements, for example, if there are 3 vertex
indices that means there is only a single triangle in the geometry
block.

Finally come the indices into the data.  These come in the same order
(vertex indices, then normal indices, then texture coordinate indices,
followed by color indices), and again are sized as given in the header.
However, index data is always stored as 32-bit unsigned integers.

Contribute Back
---------------

While not strictly related to the main purpose of this document, we
would like to take this opportunity to encourage you to make any
changes you make to ImageVis3D's source code available.

ImageVis3D is an open source project.  You can download the source,
modify it to your heart's content, and redistribute it however you
would like.  The licensing is incredibly liberal; you could even
recompile it as-is and sell it as a commercial product.  It is not
*required* that you make your source available.  It is not *required*
that you participate in future development.  However, it is in
everyone's best interest that you do so.

Benefits of Contribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The benefits to the ImageVis3D project are somewhat obvious.  If you
write some code to allow ImageVis3D to read a new type of data, anyone
else can then pick up the program and use it to visualize that kind of
data.  This enables ImageVis3D to be used in more domains, increasing
the project's user base, which significantly helps us pursue funding
for development of ImageVis3D features and maintenance.

However, contributing your code actually helps *you* as well:

- The lead developers will verify that your format is still readable
with each new release of ImageVis3D
- Internal APIs within ImageVis3D change from time to time; if your
source is part of ImageVis3D, we will update your code to adhere to the
new interface.
* It is safe to assume that, if your code is not part of the ImageVis3D
tree, it will eventually stop compiling and require manual edits.
* New features added to ImageVis3D will automatically apply to your
format/code.
- Your code will receive more testing than you could perform on your
own.

What We Ask From Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We ask that you don't just throw a bunch of files at us and expect we
do the work of merging in changes or fixing blatant issues.  We ask
that you submit:

- Well-formatted, complete patches
* `svn diff` (or even `git diff`) formats are preferred, as opposed to files
* Patches should be against the current source in version control, not against
the previous release.
* If plausible, split multiple changes into multiple patches
* Each change should compile and work if applied in order (i.e. do not have one
patch break the build and the next one fix it -- just use one patch).
* Should compile using MSVC and recent gcc's.
** We understand that you might not have both these compilers available.
Please just do the best you can.
* Use MESSAGE, WARNING, and T_ERROR to give information on what the code is
doing.
* Try to break lines at 80 characters
* Remove whitespace at the end of each line
- Rights to distribute your code under the MIT license
* Do note that permission to do this might have to come not just from yourself,
but from your organization and/or funding organization as well.  Do *not*
_assume_ you have the right to distribute code you have written!
* More general rights are fine too; you might release the code into the public
domain, for example.
- For support of new file formats:
* At least one dataset which can be read by the new code
* An image of the dataset, preferably rendered in some other software,
though an ImageVis3D image is acceptable.  We will use this to verify that
the code actually works.

The dataset request is a *requirement*, not an option.  No exceptions!
If we cannot test your code, it *will* break at some point.  Even if
your file format is common, do not assume we will go scouring the web
for sample data -- that is your responsibility.

Logistics
~~~~~~~~~

You should send your patches to the
link:https://lists.sci.utah.edu/sympa/subscribe/tuvok-developers[tuvok-developers]
mailing list.  If you have very small sample data (i.e. measured in kilobytes),
you can send that along through the list as well.  If your sample data are
large, you may:

- Upload them via FTP to `ftp.sci.utah.edu`; anonymous uploads are
allowed in the `upload` directory.
- Use the `Report an Issue` dialog and attach the dataset and sample
image to the bug report.  Be sure to include your email and at least a
brief message mentioning the thread you've started on tuvok-developers.

In both cases, please send a ping to
link:https://lists.sci.utah.edu/sympa/subscribe/tuvok-developers[tuvok-developers]
and let us know you've uploaded data.  You'll need to send a mail there
anyway, to include the patches.

Privacy
+++++++

Please note any restrictions on the data at submission time.  We
are used to receiving data which we are not allowed to use in our
publications, or that we are not allowed to demo, etc.  If this
restriction is time-limited (i.e. "do not demo this until I've
published a paper about <X>!"), please note that as well.

Do note that any data which is uploaded to SCI via FTP, or uploaded via
ImageVis3D's "Report an Issue" feature, is readable by any member of
the SCI Institute.  The ImageVis3D developers will gladly copy it to
our workstations and then delete it from the public FTP as quickly as
possible, but there will always be a window where data are available to
the internal network.

Furthermore, the SCI Institute is an Institute within a University.
Security policies are somewhat liberal; there is not a notion of
a "secure network" versus an "open network", as is common at some
national labs.  We will make reasonable efforts to ensure your data
remain as private as you would like, but do recognize that no computer
network is ever completely secure, and SCI is no different.  As such,
please do not send us extremely sensitive data.
